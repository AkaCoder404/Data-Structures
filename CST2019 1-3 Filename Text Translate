Description
  Xiao Y found that the file name submitted by everyone was not standardized during the correction work, which gavehim a headache. As a patient with obsessive compulsive disorder, he decide to manually regulate the file name of everyone. But some people have a particularly long file name, and he wants to know how many times it needs to be modified to make the string A into the string B. Of course, we will choose to give up the name of the file whose cost is more than K.
  
  Define a modification cost:
  
  1. Insert a character K at the i-th position
    ...(Si−1)(Si)(Si+1)...->(Si−1)(K)(Si)(Si+1)...
  2. Delete the ith character
    ...(Si−1)(Si)(Si+1)...->(Si−1)(Si+1)...

Input
  In total there are 3 lines. 
  The first lines includes 3 integers N, M, K, which represent the length of the original string A, the length of the target string B and the maximum number of modifications of the limit.
  The next 2 lines contain the original string A and the target string B, respectively.
  
Output
  Ouput one line, if the minimum number of modifications is equal to or less than k,then output the lowest amount of modifications necessary, or else output -1.

Sample Input
  10 11 5
  9873007613
  87300676513
  
  *this is the first test case
  *in the problems given, problems with non-full integer inputs will sometimes use the sample as the first test case.

Sample Output
  3
  
  *OJ ignores newline characters and end of text.
