Description
"The world's general trend, the long-term must be combined, the long-term must be divided", the same is true of the stock market: new shares are continuously issued, and old stocks have been withdrawn. The period from issue to exit is called the active period of the stock.

For the sake of simplicity, it may be assumed here that the active period is based on the trading day, and the (zeroth) day of the stock market opening is used as a unified starting point. For example, if Stock A “issued on Day 123 and exits on Day 130”, its active period is Days 123-129 for a total of 7 days, recorded as [123, 130). In addition, it may be assumed that the prices of the stocks remain unchanged during the period of their activities – otherwise, they may be equivalent to the exit of the original stock and issue a stock with updated pricing. Although the stock market of Q Kingdom cannot be refined, it also has its own unique features. In the country's stock market, the active periods of different stocks are prohibited from being included in each other. For example, whether it is [100, 150) and [120, 130), [120, 130) and [120, 150), [100, 130) and [120, 130), or even [120, 130) and [120 , 130), neither will be the active period of the stock at the same time. In other words, there are no more than one stock issued and delisted each day.

Mr. M is a recognized god of the Q Kingdom, and his strategy is both safe and simple. The so-called security means that the total amount of investment at any time remains fixed, thus ensuring limited risk. The so-called simplicity means that every day, all the investment is concentrated on the purchase of the lowest price of the stock on the day (for which it may be necessary to sell the original stock, the time required for the transaction is negligible), so his shareholding Staying the best every day – in the Q Kingdom, this is the primary indicator of stock market returns.
